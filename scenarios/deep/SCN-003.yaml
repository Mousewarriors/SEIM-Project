playbook:
  name: Lateral Movement Investigation
  steps:
    - >-
      Identify initial execution chain on source endpoint (Office →
      cmd/powershell).
    - Review SMB connections and tool usage (PsExec).
    - Confirm remote service creation on target and commands executed.
    - Extract IOCs (download URL, external IP, hashes) and validate.
    - >-
      Hunt for additional lateral movement attempts (SMB/WinRM/RDP) and new
      services.
    - >-
      Containment: disable compromised account, isolate hosts, block external
      IOCs, reset credentials.
answer:
  verdict: true_positive
  severity: high
  summary: >
    Confirmed lateral movement via PsExec. Attack chain started with a
    macro-enabled document executing cmd.exe, followed by discovery commands
    (net user, whoami). The attacker then used PsExec to move laterally to
    SRV-FILE-01, creating a remote service (PSEXESVC). External payload was
    downloaded from cdn-assets-update.com.
  key_findings:
    - Macro document triggered cmd.exe execution chain
    - Discovery commands executed (net user, whoami, ipconfig)
    - PsExec used for lateral movement to file server
    - Remote service PSEXESVC created on SRV-FILE-01
    - External payload downloaded from cdn-assets-update.com
