playbook:
  name: Data Exfiltration Investigation
  steps:
    - Validate archive creation (process lineage, file path, size/hash).
    - >-
      Pivot to DNS and TLS/SNI logs for destination domain/IP and first-seen
      status.
    - >-
      Quantify data transfer and identify what was uploaded (file name, time
      correlation).
    - Check for staging tools (curl/rclone/megacmd) and persistence mechanisms.
    - >-
      Scope hunt: other hosts contacting same destination; other archives
      created.
    - >-
      Containment: isolate host, block destination, investigate user account,
      notify stakeholders.
answer:
  verdict: true_positive
  severity: critical
  summary: >
    Confirmed data exfiltration incident. A large archive was created on
    WKSTN-022 and uploaded via HTTPS to fileshare-sync.net, a rare/uncommon
    external destination. Persistence was established via a Windows Run registry
    key. The data transfer volume and destination suggest intentional
    exfiltration of sensitive data.
  key_findings:
    - Large archive file created using staging tools
    - Data uploaded via HTTPS to fileshare-sync.net (rare destination)
    - Persistence mechanism via Run registry key
    - Significant data transfer volume to external IP 193.29.13.88
