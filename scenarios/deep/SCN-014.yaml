    Rogue internal host responded to name resolution, captured NTLM, and relayed
    to server resulting in remote service install attempts.

playbook:
  name: NTLM Relay / Name Resolution Poisoning Triage
  steps:
    - >-
      Review name resolution events (WPAD/LLMNR/NBNS) and identify unexpected
      responders.
    - Correlate SMB/HTTP NTLM authentication attempts to rogue internal IPs.
    - >-
      Validate server-side artifacts (new service installs, temp binaries,
      scheduled tasks).
    - >-
      Check DC authentication anomalies for NTLM usage spikes and privileged
      account exposure.
    - >-
      Scope hunt for other hosts contacting the rogue IP or same service
      name/binary hash.
    - >-
      Containment: isolate rogue device, disable LLMNR/NBNS where possible,
      rotate affected creds, remediate server artifacts.
