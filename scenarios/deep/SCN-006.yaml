  steps:
    - Review suspicious process execution and command line.
    - Confirm Kerberos TGS request patterns (4769) and targeted SPNs.
    - Check for hash artifacts written to disk and potential exfiltration.
    - Pivot to outbound traffic (DNS/TLS) to identify destinations.
    - Hunt for subsequent lateral movement (SMB/WMI/WinRM).
    - >-
      Containment: reset service account credentials, isolate host, block IOCs,
      review privileged group membership.
